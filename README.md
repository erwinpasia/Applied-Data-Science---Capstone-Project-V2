# [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate's Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/verify/WF55WBMGFHB9) - COMPLETED!
This Capstone provides the "opportunity to demonstrate" all the skills learned from course_1 up to course_9 of the "Data Science Professional Certificate" program.

This is the final course in the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" as well as the "Applied Data Science with Python Specialization" programs. This capstone project course will give the Professional or Specialization Certificate completer the chance to practice the work that "Data Scientists" do in real life when working with datasets.  

In this course, the student  will assume the role of a "Data Scientist" working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving Data Collections, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualizations, Machine Learning Model Development, Machine Learning Model Evaluation, and Reporting the results to "Stakeholders".  

The student will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of the Data Science findings and models, the competing startup with the help of the "student a.k.a hired Data Scientist" can then make more informed bids (Data-Driven Decisions) against SpaceX for a rocket launch.  

In this course there will be not much new learning, instead students will "focus on hands-on work" to demonstrate and apply what they have learnt in the previous courses.

By successfully completing this Capstone, certified students will have added a project to their Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio to showcase to employers.
